## Chunks in Sherlock Holmes  

### Chapter 1  
### Self  
1. The girl I've long coveted was finally **in my possession.**  
2. **As far as I know** he is a decent fellow enough.  
3. **Now that** I do know it I shall do my best to forget it.  
4. A fool **takes in** all the lumber of every sort that he **comes across**, so that the knowledge which might be useful to him **gets crowded out**, or at best **is jumbled up** with a lot of other things, so that he has a difficulty in laying his hands upon it.  
5. Depend upon it **there comes a time when** for every addition of knowledge you forget something that you knew before.  
6. If we went round the moon it would not **make a pennyworth of difference** to me or to my work.  
7. He said that he would acquire no knowledge which did not **bear upon** his object.  
8. I **could not help smiling** at the document when I had completed it.  
9. 

### Inspect the objective  
1. “Certainly,” I answered, and the conversation **drifted away into** other channels.  
2. **When it comes to** music, I'm a complete ignoramus.  

### Interaction  
1. He could not get someone to **go halves with** him in some nice rooms.  
2. You mustn’t blame me if you don‘t **get on with** him.  

### Inspect others  
1. What is there against him?  
2. How **on earth** did you know that?  


### Chapter 2  
1. Nothing of the sort.
