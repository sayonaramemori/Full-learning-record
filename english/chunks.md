## Chunks  

### Self  
1. The girl I've long coveted was finally **in my possession.**  
2. **As far as I know** he is a decent fellow enough.  

### Inspect the objective  
1. “Certainly,” I answered, and the conversation **drifted away into** other channels.  
2. **When it comes to** music, I'm a complete ignoramus.  

### Interaction  
1. He could not get someone to **go halves with** him in some nice rooms.  
2. You mustn’t blame me if you don‘t **get on with** him.  

### Inspect others  
1. What is there against him?  
2. How **on earth** did you know that?
