### Why graphs  
> Many Types of Data are  Graphs  

> Graph is the common natural language   

### Graph presentation  

#### Adjacency Matrix  
> N nodes, the matrix is nxn(A sparse matrix)

#### Edge list  
![edge](./img/edge_list.jpg)  

#### Adjacency list  
![adjacency_list](./img/adjacency_list.jpg)  


#### Ontology  
1. How to design node and connections?  
2. Undirected and directed.  
3. A heterogeneous graph, different nodes with different connections.

### Node Degrees

### Connected graph  
> Any two vertices can be joined by path.  

> Strongly connected components: nodes can reach each other.  

### Traditional graph machine learning  

#### Feature engineering  
1. Using effective features over graphs is the key to achieving good model performance.  
2. Traditional ML pipeline uses **hand-designed** features.
