### Particle Size Analysis  
1. To establish the degree of liberation of the values from them gangue.  
2. To determine the optimum size of the feed to the process for maximum efficiency.  
3. To determine the size range at which any losses are occurring in the plant.  

#### Pariticle size and shape  
> For irregular particles, it is desirable to quote the size of a particle in terms of a single quantity, and the expression most often used is the "equivalent diameter." This refers to the diameter of a sphere that would behave in the same manner as the particle when submitted to some specified opereation.  


### Froth Flotation  
> Definition: Flotation is a separation process that exploits natural and induced differences in surface properties of the materials, whether the surface is readily wetted by water, that is *hydrophilic*, or repels water, that is, is *hydrophobic*.
