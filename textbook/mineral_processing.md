### Particle Size Analysis  
1. To establish the degree of liberation of the values from them gangue.  
2. To determine the optimum size of the feed to the process for maximum efficiency.  
3. To determine the size range at which any losses are occurring in the plant.  

#### Pariticle size and shape  
> For irregular particles, it is desirable to quote the size of a particle in terms of a single quantity, and the expression most often used is the "equivalent diameter." This refers to the diameter of a sphere that would behave in the same manner as the particle when submitted to some specified opereation.  


## Froth Flotation  
- Flotation is a separation process that exploits natural and induced differences in surface properties of the materials, whether the surface is readily wetted by water, that is *hydrophilic*, or repels water, that is, is *hydrophobic*.  


##### Three mechanisms for recovering materials  
1. Selective attachment to air bubbles (or "true flotation").  
2. Entrainment in the water which passes through the froth.
3. Physical entrapment between particles in the froth attached to air bubbles(often refered to as "aggregation").  

##### Optimum size range for flotation  
- Relatively fine particles can be applied with flotation  

##### Functions  
- The relationship between recovery and grade is a trade-off.  
- $\gamma_{s/a}=\gamma_{s/w}+\gamma_{w/a}\cos\theta$, where gamma notations are surface tensions and theta is the contact angle between the mineral surface and the bubble.  
- Work of adhesion, $W_{s/a}=\gamma_{s/w}+\gamma_{w/a}-\gamma_{s/a}$, combining the equation above gives: 
	- $W_{s/a}=\gamma_{w/a}(1-\cos\theta)$
	- $W_{s/a}'=k\times\sin\theta$ is greater than zero ,where $\theta$ is in $(0,\pi)$ 
	- The hydrophobicity of a mineral increases with the contact angle and work of adhesion

##### Properties of surface  
> All minerals are classified into *polar* or *nonpolar* types according to their surface characteristics.  

- Thus: 
	1. The minerals are composed of covalent molecules held together by van der Waals forces, and the nonpolar surface do not readily attach to the water dipoles, and in consequence are naturally hydrophobic, with contact angles between $60\degree$and $90\degree$. Minerals of this type, such as graphite, sulfur, molybdenite, diamond, coal, and talc, have high natural float-abilitys.
	2. Minerals with strong covalent or ionic surface bonding are known as polar types and react strongly with water molecules; these minerals are naturally hydropilic.

- Hydropilicity is associated with high solid surface energy and hydrophobicity with low solid surface energy, where high and low are relative to the surface energy of water($\gamma_{w/a}~about~72mJm^{-2}$).  
- In general, therefore, the degree of polarity, and thus surface energy and hydrophilicity, increases from sulfide minerals, through sulfates, to carbonates, halites, phosphates, etc., then to oxides-hydroxides, and, finally, silicates and quartz, which are strongly hydrophilic.
