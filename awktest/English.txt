Let's see how to setup v2ray on linux
Firstly open the website for release distribution
Download your version 
As for my version linux-64 satisfys
Then back to windows open v2ray GUI client
Select your nodes in good state and export it as client config
Here I export it to desktop
I use sftp to transfer it to the home directory
Unzip it into the v2ray directory
Test whether the application works or not
All the preparation works have been down until now
Create a new shell script contains these commands
Run it with bash
Next we simply start it
Do a test to ensure it has run correctly
