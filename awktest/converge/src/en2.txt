Let's show you how to create a NodeId in Rust.
The first method takes a namespace and an identifier
The second method takes a NodeId string.
Then look at the definition of the read function
This function takes an atomically counted reference
to a real session protected by a read/write lock.
The second argument is the NodeId
First we put a read lock on the mutex.
to get the real session inside it
Then we convert the NodeId to a ReadValueId.
and then we call the read API from the real session.
Note that the first parameter is an array reference
Use matching to handle both success and failure results
Here we print the value read and the corresponding time.
You can see that the read was successful.
Next, let's see how to read multiple values at the same time.
We come to the definition of the read function
The difference is that the second parameter is a vector of NodeIds.
Here, the conversion of the Id type is done using an iterator.
Everything else remains the same
Finally, let's test it.
You can see that the two values are read successfully at the same time
