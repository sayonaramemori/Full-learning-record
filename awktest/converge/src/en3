Let's see how to write a value to a node
First, we come to the definition of the write function
This function takes a Session, NodeId, and Variant.
You can click on Variant to see that it is a type enumeration.
Then it creates a DataValue based on the Variant.
Then it creates a WriteValue based on the DataValue and NodeId.
Put a read lock on the Session
Finally, we call the WriteValue API, noting that the parameter is an array reference to the WriteValue.
When the entire write operation fails, we print the reason for the failure.
On success, a vector of StatusCodes is returned, indicating whether the corresponding WriteValue was successfully written.
Since we only passed in one WriteValue, there is only one element in the result vector.
We iterate through the result vector, and if Status is good, we print that the write was successful.
Back to the test code, here we are writing one value per second to multiple nodes of different types.
Run the test code, and you can see that the write succeeded.
